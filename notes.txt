Yes, if you decide to use a public IPFS gateway library, you don't need to run your own IPFS node. You can point to a node provided by a service (like Infura, Pinata, or others) and allow users to interact with IPFS through your frontend UI. This setup simplifies the process for you and your users, especially for those who are not familiar with how IPFS works.

Individual Images and Metadata
For individual images and metadata, the process is straightforward:

User Interaction: Users select an image and possibly enter metadata through your frontend UI.
Upload to IPFS: Your application uses the IPFS HTTP client library to upload the image and metadata to IPFS. This can be done by calling the add method for each file.
Retrieve IPFS URIs: After the upload, the IPFS gateway returns URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) for the uploaded content. These URIs can then be used in your smart contract to mint NFTs or for other purposes.
Collections of Images and Metadata
For collections or folders of images and metadata, the process involves a few more steps but is still manageable:

User Interaction: Users select multiple images and their corresponding metadata. Your UI might need to provide a way to associate specific metadata with each image.
Upload to IPFS: You can use the IPFS HTTP client library to upload each image and metadata file individually. However, for a more organized approach, you might consider creating a single JSON file that includes links to all images and their metadata, then upload this JSON file.
Batch Uploads: Some IPFS client libraries support batch uploads, allowing you to upload multiple files in one go. This is done by passing an array of files to the add method. If you're handling a collection, this can be more efficient.
Retrieve IPFS URIs: For each uploaded file or for the batch upload, you'll receive IPFS URIs. If you're using a single JSON file for a collection, you'll get a single URI pointing to this JSON, which contains links to all images and metadata within the collection.
Multiple Uploads and Folders
Multiple Uploads: The IPFS HTTP client library supports uploading multiple files. This can be done by iterating over the files selected by the user and uploading them one by one or using batch upload features if the library supports it.
Folders: While IPFS itself doesn't have a concept of folders in the traditional filesystem sense, it can simulate folders by linking files together. Some client libraries allow you to upload files in a way that preserves their hierarchical structure, effectively creating a "folder" on IPFS.
