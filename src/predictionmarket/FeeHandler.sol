/**
 * This contract aggregates the fees collected from different actions in the ecosystem (e.g., trading, minting, or
 * resolving markets) for later distribution.
 * Key Features to Include:
 *
 * Fee Splitting: Decide how fees are distributed:
 * To the platform treasury.
 * To liquidity providers (if incentivizing them).
 * To governance token holders (if introducing governance).
 * Fee Configurability: Allow the admin (or a DAO) to adjust fee rates, ensuring flexibility as the platform evolves.
 * Implementation Options:
 *
 * Add fee logic directly to each relevant contract (e.g., include a mintingFee or swapFee percentage).
 * Alternatively, deploy a standalone fee collector contract that other contracts call when transferring fees.
 *
 * Connect AMM and Fee Contracts:
 *
 * AMM swaps should call the fee collector to deposit swap fees.
 * Market creation or resolution functions can integrate with the fee collector for minting or settlement fees.
 * Test Contracts Together:
 *
 * Simulate real user flows: mint tokens, trade them via AMM, and collect fees to ensure compatibility.
 * Modularization:
 *
 * Keep fee logic modular to allow future upgrades (e.g., different fee rates for minting vs. trading).
