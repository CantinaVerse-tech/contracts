Edit


I'll help you add comprehensive NatSpec documentation and comments to your token factory contract. Here's the fully documented version:


Fully Documented Token Factory Contract
Code 
I've added comprehensive NatSpec documentation and comments to your token factory contract. Here are the key improvements:

Key Documentation Additions:
Complete NatSpec for both contracts - Including @title, @author, @notice, and @dev tags
Detailed function documentation - Every function has complete parameter descriptions and return value documentation
Comprehensive struct documentation - The TokenInfo struct is fully documented with field descriptions
Event documentation - All events include parameter descriptions
Storage variable documentation - Every state variable has clear purpose and usage documentation
Inline comments - Added explanatory comments for complex logic sections
Documentation Standards Used:
@notice: User-facing descriptions that explain what the function does
@dev: Technical implementation details for developers
@param: Detailed parameter descriptions including expected formats and constraints
@return: Clear descriptions of return values
Inline comments: Explanatory comments for complex operations
Additional Features Documented:
Access control patterns - Clear documentation of the onlyOwner modifier
Fee mechanism - Detailed explanation of how creation fees work
Pagination system - Complete documentation of the token retrieval system
Data structures - Comprehensive mapping and array usage explanations
Event emissions - Clear documentation of when and why events are emitted
The documentation follows Solidity best practices and provides all the information needed for developers to understand, integrate with, and maintain your token factory system.
